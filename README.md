# World Bartender Tool
A streamlined digital menu and emote management tool designed specifically for bartenders, cashiers, and service workers in the GTA:W community. This application simplifies the process of managing menu items, tracking prices, and executing roleplay emotes, making customer service interactions smoother and more immersive.

Whether you're running a coffee shop, bar, restaurant, or any service business in GTA:W, this tool helps you stay organized and provide professional service while maintaining the roleplay experience your customers expect.

## The Problem
Working in service roles within GTA:W's text-based roleplay environment presents unique challenges:

- **Manual Emote Management**: Constantly typing out complex roleplay emotes for every customer interaction becomes tedious and time-consuming
- **Slow Service**: Having to manually type everything results in long wait times, especially during busy periods with multiple customers
- **Inconsistent Roleplay**: Without standardized emotes, service quality varies and may not meet the community's roleplay standards
- **Customer Experience**: Long delays and inconsistent service can frustrate customers and hurt business reputation
- **Staff Training**: New employees struggle to learn proper emotes and pricing without a centralized system
